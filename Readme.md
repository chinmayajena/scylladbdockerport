# How to run Scylladb in different port

Running ScyllaDB inside a Docker container with a custom CQL port requires a few modifications. You would need to set the appropriate configuration options and expose the necessary ports in your Dockerfile and when you run the Docker container.

Hereâ€™s how you can achieve this:

### Step 1: Create a Custom ScyllaDB Configuration File

Create a custom `scylla.yaml` file with the `native_transport_port` set to your desired port. For example:

```yaml
native_transport_port: 9142
```

### Step 2: Create a Dockerfile

Create a Dockerfile to build your ScyllaDB image. In this Dockerfile, you will copy your custom `scylla.yaml` file into the image and expose the custom CQL port.

```Dockerfile
# Use the official ScyllaDB image as the base image
FROM scylladb/scylla

# Copy the custom configuration file into the container
COPY scylla.yaml /etc/scylla/

# Expose the custom CQL port
EXPOSE 9142
```

### Step 3: Build Your Docker Image

Run the following command in the directory containing your Dockerfile and custom `scylla.yaml` file:

```sh
docker build -t my-scylladb-image .
```

This command builds your Docker image and tags it as `my-scylladb-image`.

### Step 4: Run Your ScyllaDB Container

After building the image, you can run a container from it, making sure to map the custom CQL port:

```sh
docker run -p 9142:9142 --name my-scylladb-container -d my-scylladb-image
```

In this command:

- `-p 9142:9142` maps port 9142 on your host to port 9142 on the container.
- `--name my-scylladb-container` sets the name of your container.
- `-d` runs the container in detached mode.

### Step 5: Verify Connectivity

You can now connect to ScyllaDB using the CQL port `9142`.

```sh
cqlsh <Docker_Host_IP> 9142
```

Replace `<Docker_Host_IP>` with the IP address of your Docker host.

By following these steps, you will have a Dockerized ScyllaDB instance running with a CQL port different from the default `9042`. Ensure that the port is open and accessible from your client's location.
